            <h1>  Is it hard to Learn? </h1>
            
          <p> Many books that teach HTML and CSS
resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for
you to learn, we threw away the traditional
template used by publishers and redesigned
this book from scratch.</p>

<p>At work, when people look
              at my screen and see it full of
              code, it's not unusual to get a
              comment about it looking very
              complicated or how clever I must
              be to understand it. The truth
              is, it's not that hard to learn how
              to write web pages and read
              the code used to create them;
              you certainly don't have to be a
              "programmer."
              <br>
             <p> Understanding HTML and CSS
              can help anyone who works
              with the web; designers can
              create more attractive and
              usable sites, website editors can
              create better content, marketers
              can communicate with their
              audience more effectively, and
              managers can commission
              better sites and get the best out
              of their teams.</p>
              <br>
             <p> I've focussed on the code you
              need to use 90% of the time
              and omitted the code that you
              would rarely see even if writing
              websites is your full time job. By
              the end of the book, if you come
              across the other 10% you will be
              able to Google it to find out what
              it means quickly and easily.
              I have also added practical
              information on topics I am
              commonly asked about, such as
              how to prepare images, audio
              and video for the web, how to
              approach the design and build
              of a new site, how to improve
              your rankings in search engines
              (SEO), and how to use Google
              Analytics to learn about visitors
              to your site.
