                            <p>In order to teach you about creating web pages,
                                          this book is divided into three sections:</p>
                                          <br>
                            <li>1: HTML
                                          We will spend the first chapter
                                          looking at how HTML is used to
                                          create web pages. You will see
                                          that you start by writing down
                                          the words you want to appear
                                          on your page. You then add tags
                                          or elements to the words so
                                          that the browser knows what is
                                          a heading, where a paragraph
                                          begins and ends, and so on.
                                          The rest of this section
                                          introduces the tags you have
                                          at your disposal to create web
                                          pages, grouped into chapters on:
                                          text, lists, links, images, tables,
                                          forms, video audio and flash, and
                                          miscellaneous elements.
                                          I should warn you that the
                                          examples in the first nine
                                          chapters are not exciting to look
                                          at, yet they are the foundation of
                                          every web page. The following
                                          chapters on CSS will show you
                                          how to make your pages look a
                                          lot more interesting.</li>

                            <li>2: CSS
                                          We start this section with a
                                          chapter that explains how CSS
                                          uses rules to enable you to
                                          control the styling and layout
                                          of web pages. We then go on to
                                          look at the wide variety of CSS
                                          properties you can use in your
                                          CSS rules. These properties
                                          generally fall into one of two
                                          categories:
                                          Presentation: How to control
                                          things like the color of text, the
                                          fonts you want to use and the
                                          size of those fonts, how to add
                                          background colors to pages (or
                                          parts of a page), and how to add
                                          background images.

                                          the different elements are
                                          positioned on the screen. You
                                          will also learn several techniques
                                          that professionals use to make
                                          their pages more attractive.</li>

                                          We end up with some helpful
                                          information that will assist you in
                                          building better websites.
                                          We look at some new tags that
                                          will be introduced in HTML5 to
                                          help describe the structure of
                                          your pages. HTML5 is the latest
                                          version of HTML (still under
                                          development at the time of
                                          writing). Before learning about
                                          these elements, you need a good
                                          grasp of how CSS is used to
                                          control the design of web pages.
                                          There is a chapter that talks you
                                          through a design process that
                                          you might like to follow when
                                          creating a new website.
                                          Finally, we end up looking at
                                          topics that will help you once
                                          you have built your site, such

                                          engine optimisation (SEO) and
                                          using analytics software to track
                                          who comes to your site and what
                                          they are looking at.</li>
